<h2 class="homeHeaders">About Sabre Printer</h2>
	<div class="homeDivs">
		<p class="homeText padTop">These three simple hues work together in Sabre printers to produce the full spectrum of colors on our Dunder Mifflin paper. Likewise, our "Print in All Colors" initiative uses the diversity of our employees to produce Sabre's premiere collection of printers and all-in-one machines.</p>
		<p class="homeText">Encouraging diversity not only gives a leg up to deserving people but allows Sabre to pull ideas and inventions from the widest collection of the most colorful minds on the planet. Our employees' brains are as cutting edge as our printers and they keep this company moving forward. Without diversity of thought, talent and experience, we might still be making dot matrix printers.</p>
		<p class="homeText padBottom">To encourage innovations and superb customer service, Sabre recruits, hires, trains, and promotes without regard to race, skin tone, gender, age, religion, marital status, disability, sexual orientation, national origin, veteran status, or surgical history. Our Junior Executive Trainee program (a part of "Print in All Colors") seeks out Sabre's best and brightest employees who otherwise would not be considered for management. These future leaders take with them not only their great minds and beautiful hearts but a cultural understanding that is unmatched. We encourage employees of color to apply.</p>
